    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>

    <h2>WHAT IS SCALP MICROPIGMENTATION</h2>
    <h3>Scalp Micropigmentation is safe, non-surgical and non-invasive treatment, which is affordable solution for
      restoring confidence in both male and female individuals, who suffer from hair loss. Through detailed
      micro-needles, organic pigment is deposited at the epidermal level of the scalp, naturally replicating the
      appearance of real shaved hair follicle. This effect is 100% natural looking and is not recognizable as a hair
      simulation. By accurately replicating your own natural hair follicles and hair color, scalp micropigmentation
      can
      add density to thinning areas, creating an undetectable illusion of thicker, stronger and fuller hair. Further
      to
      that SMP is affordable solution for covering scars, received from previous hair transplant surgery or any
      other
      reason. In most cases, an SMP treatment lasts for three to five years before the patient needs to have another
      treatment done because of the fading of the pigments.

      <div class="col-5">

        <h3>Scalp micropigmentation treatments usually are split over three sessions, although the actual time can
          vary
          depending on the area treated, the style you require, and other factors. Typically the first session lasts
          from
          two to four hours, while the additional sessions usually take less time as the correct blend of density
          and
          darkness is achieved on the scalp.

    <h2>DOES IT HURT?</h2>
    <h3>Micro pigmentation is a non-invasive treatment, therefore there is very little or no pain experienced. It is
      possible the appearance of a mild skin redness, due to denser scalp nerve endings in some patients, which however
      should settle within a few hours following the treatment.</h3>
    <h3>There is no need for a special maintenance once treatments are complete. The procedure does not affect daily
      routine and activities. A complete aftercare guide is provided throughout the treatment sessions.

        <h3>Scalp micropigmentation is suitable for both men and women however, there is a difference between SMP for
          men and women.</h3>
        <h3>Like men, women also can suffer from hair loss or thinning hair. In most of the cases however, women tend to
          lose hair evenly and is very unlikely that they go completely bald. SMP is used to restore the denser look of
          healthy hair and reduce the contrast between the scalp and the hairline in this case.</h3>
        <h3>While most of the male patients would require to shave down their hair prior to the treatment, this is not
          necessary for female patients. Instead, the practitioner applies pigmentation by parting the hair section by
          section.</h3>
